- **Face Recognition**: DeepFace library for face recognition
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user management
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK**: Ensure Flutter is installed. You can download it from [Flutter’s official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. **Firebase Account**: Set up a Firebase project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
3. **DeepFace**: Ensure you have Python installed to use DeepFace for face recognition. DeepFace can be installed via pip.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riskiananda90/MomEase-Face-Recognation.git
   cd MomEase-Face-Recognation
   ```

2. **Set Up Firebase**

   - Go to your Firebase Console, create a new project, and enable **Firestore Database** and **Firebase Authentication**.
   - Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS and add them to the appropriate directories in your Flutter project.

3. **Install Dependencies**

   - **Flutter dependencies**: Navigate to the Flutter project directory and run:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```

   - **DeepFace for Face Recognition**: Install DeepFace via pip (requires Python):
     ```bash
     pip install deepface
     ```

4. **Environment Variables (Optional)**

   If you are using environment-specific configurations, you can set them up using `.env` files for Firebase keys, API keys, or other settings.

5. **Run the Application**

   - **Backend**: If there is a separate backend for any additional processing, start it here.
   - **Frontend**: Run the Flutter app
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

## Usage

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Users can sign up or log in using face recognition. Upon login, DeepFace will verify the user’s face against the saved data in Firebase.
2. **View Medical Records**: Authorized users can view, edit, and manage their medical records stored in Firebase Firestore.
3. **Update Profile and Preferences**: Users can update their personal details and configure settings.
4. **Data Security**: Sensitive information is securely stored and accessible only to authenticated users.
